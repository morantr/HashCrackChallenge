# HashCrackChallenge

Crack hashed password from IEEE Xtreme challenge.

## Introducation

When I was a student in college, my Cyber Security teacher gave us an IEEE Xtreme challenge to crack
as many passwords as we can from a list of SHA-256 hashed and base64 encoded passwords.
Back then I was a rookie programmer and I wasn't able to crack any of the passwords from the file
using generated strings.
Eventually, I used a file containing tons of common passwords instead of generating it myself and
found only ten passwords.
This time, when I have more programming experience I'll try to do it again, but with much more
attention to performance.

The follow-up commit will contain the C code that I wrote back then. It will be refactored and
converted to a modern C++.
